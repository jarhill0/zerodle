Zerodle is a variant of Wordle, inspired by the likes of
[Quordle](https://www.quordle.com/) and
[Sedecordle](https://www.sedecordle.com/).
Each of these games presents a certain number of Wordle puzzles which must
be solved simultaneously on the same guesses.

Zerodle takes this concept to the extreme, with a grand total of zero
different Wordle puzzles, all of which must be solved at once.
